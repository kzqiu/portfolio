Having just started a new year, I thought that it might be interesting to make a blog so I could write down some of my thoughts as I figure out my journey and path. This entire page is completely new, but I think I'm going to mainly post things about things that I'm learning and about things that I've created recently. I don't have much else to say right now, but stay posted (if you want to) for (potentially) more of my thoughts!
